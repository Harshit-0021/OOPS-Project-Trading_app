## description of files

### **Stock.h and Stock.cpp**: 
- **Stock.h**: This file defines the Stock class, which represents a stock with attributes such as symbol (ticker symbol) and price (current stock price). It also declares the class constructor and an equality operator to compare stocks based on their symbol.

- **Stock.cpp**: This file contains the implementation of the methods declared in Stock.h. It includes the constructor to initialize stock objects and the equality operator to check if two stocks have the same symbol.

Together, these files manage the basic structure and behavior of stock objects used in the trading system.

### **Account.h and Account.cpp**: 
- **Account.h**: This file defines the Account class, which represents a user's trading account. The class includes attributes like accountID (unique identifier for the account), balance (the available funds in the account), and holdings (a list of stocks owned by the user along with their quantities). It also declares various methods for managing account operations, including depositing funds, buying and selling stocks, checking stock holdings, and calculating the total worth of stocks.

- **Account.cpp**: This file provides the implementation of the methods declared in Account.h. It defines the functionality to deposit money into the account, buy and sell stocks (checking if the user has sufficient funds or stock holdings), and display account information. Additionally, it tracks the purchase price of stocks to calculate profit or loss when selling.

Together, these files handle the core functionality of a user's trading account, including managing funds, stock holdings, and executing trades.

### **Transaction.h and Transaction.cpp**: 
- **Transaction.h**: This header file defines the Transaction class, which represents a financial transaction within the trading application. A transaction can be of three types: deposit, buy, or sell.
- **Transaction.cpp**: This file contains the implementation of the methods declared in the Transaction.h file. It defines how transactions are created and logged, including the transaction's type, status, and the date when it occurred. The displayTransaction method is implemented here to print the details of each transaction in a readable format, providing users with an overview of their trade history.
- These files together define the structure and behavior of a transaction within the trading system, ensuring that all activities (deposits, stock purchases, and sales) are recorded and can be viewed in transaction history.

### **TradingApp.h and TradingApp.cpp**: 
- **TradingApp.h**:
The TradingApp.h file defines the TradingApp class, which is responsible for managing user accounts, handling transactions, and controlling the overall flow of the application. The class includes attributes like currentAccount, which holds the active user account, and transactionHistory, which stores a record of all transactions made. The methods within the class handle account creation, logging of transactions, fetching the current date in IST, and running the application by displaying a menu for user interaction.
- **TradingApp.cpp**:
In TradingApp.cpp, the methods declared in TradingApp.h are implemented. This file handles the core functionality of the trading application. It manages account creation and deposits, facilitates stock buying and selling, and logs all transactions made by the user. The file also provides the logic for the menu system, allowing users to interact with the app by selecting options such as viewing account info, depositing money, and performing trades.
