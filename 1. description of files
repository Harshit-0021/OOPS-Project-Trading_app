## description of files

- **Stock.h and Stock.cpp**: 
Stock.h: This file defines the Stock class, which represents a stock with attributes such as symbol (ticker symbol) and price (current stock price). It also declares the class constructor and an equality operator to compare stocks based on their symbol.
